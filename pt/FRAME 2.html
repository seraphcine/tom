<br><br><font color="white", size="5", style="Garamond"> With the use of sky lanterns, people would write their wishes and attached them inside. Together with their loved ones, they release these lanterns into the night sky. The common things that people would wish for are love, prosperity and success. In the context of what we want to present, the sky lantern could also symbolize for hopeâ€“in a way that we anticipate the future with bright mindsets and an open heart. Hope, for us, is the endless horizon full of possibilities that we wish to reach.
